# Measurement & Analysis Plan

## Statistical Methods & Experimental Rigor

### Primary Statistical Approach
**Two-sample t-tests** for continuous metrics (engagement scores, listening time)
**Chi-square tests** for categorical metrics (conversion rates, retention)
**Mann-Whitney U tests** for non-normally distributed metrics (skip rates, session counts)

### Confidence Level & Power Analysis
- **Confidence Level**: 95% (α = 0.05)
- **Statistical Power**: 80% (β = 0.20)
- **Effect Size**: Minimum detectable effect varies by metric
  - Conversion rates: 3-5% relative improvement
  - Engagement metrics: 5-8% relative improvement
  - Discovery metrics: 8-10% relative improvement

### Sample Size Calculations
```
Sample Size = (Z_α/2 + Z_β)² × (σ₁² + σ₂²) / (μ₁ - μ₂)²

Where:
- Z_α/2 = 1.96 (95% confidence)
- Z_β = 0.84 (80% power)
- σ = estimated standard deviation
- μ₁ - μ₂ = minimum detectable effect
```

## Multiple Testing Problem

### Bonferroni Correction
For experiments testing multiple primary metrics simultaneously:
- **Adjusted α = 0.05 / number of primary tests**
- Experiment 1: 2 primary metrics → α = 0.025
- Experiment 2: 3 primary metrics → α = 0.017
- Experiment 3: 2 primary metrics → α = 0.025

### Hierarchical Testing Strategy
1. **Primary KPI testing** at full α level (0.05)
2. **Secondary metrics** tested only if primary metrics show significance
3. **Exploratory metrics** for hypothesis generation, not confirmation

### False Discovery Rate (FDR) Control
Using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for secondary metric analysis:
- Rank p-values from smallest to largest
- Find largest k where p(k) ≤ (k/m) × α
- Reject all hypotheses up to and including k

## Experiment Success Measurement

### Pre-Experiment Baseline Establishment
**2-week baseline period** for all metrics:
- Historical performance calculation
- Seasonality adjustment factors
- Minimum variance estimation for power calculations

### Real-time Monitoring Framework
**Daily metric dashboards** with automated alerts:
- **Green**: Metrics within expected range
- **Yellow**: 10-15% deviation from baseline (investigate)
- **Red**: >15% negative deviation (consider early termination)

### Statistical Significance Testing Timeline
- **Weekly checks**: Secondary metrics for trend monitoring
- **Bi-weekly checks**: Primary metrics for interim analysis
- **Final analysis**: End of experiment period with full statistical rigor

## Rollout Strategy for Successful Experiments

### Decision Framework
**Experiment Success Criteria:**
1. **Statistical Significance**: p < 0.05 for primary metrics
2. **Practical Significance**: Effect size meets business thresholds
3. **No Guardrail Violations**: Critical metrics remain stable
4. **Sustainable Impact**: Effect maintains significance over full period

### Rollout Phases

#### Phase 1: Validation (2 weeks)
- **Traffic**: 10% of user base
- **Monitoring**: Intensive daily monitoring
- **Criteria**: Confirm experimental results at larger scale
- **Rollback**: Immediate if any critical metric degrades

#### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout (4 weeks)
- **Week 1**: 25% traffic
- **Week 2**: 50% traffic  
- **Week 3**: 75% traffic
- **Week 4**: 100% traffic (if no issues)
- **Monitoring**: Weekly metric reviews with statistical testing

#### Phase 3: Full Implementation
- **Integration**: Merge experimental code into main systems
- **Documentation**: Update feature specifications and monitoring
- **Training**: Team education on new metrics and behaviors

### Rollback Triggers
**Immediate Rollback Conditions:**
- Any primary KPI shows >20% negative deviation
- User satisfaction scores drop >15%
- Technical errors affect >5% of traffic
- Negative PR or user feedback reaches critical threshold

**Gradual Rollback Conditions:**
- Primary metrics lose statistical significance
- Long-term trends show declining performance
- Competitive analysis shows disadvantage

## Long-term Impact Assessment

### Cohort Analysis Framework
**Monthly cohorts** tracked for 6 months post-experiment:
- User retention curves by experiment exposure
- Lifetime value progression
- Cross-experiment interaction effects

### Causal Inference Methods
**Difference-in-Differences** analysis for natural experiment validation
**Instrumental Variables** for addressing selection bias in opt-in features
**Regression Discontinuity** for threshold-based feature access

### Business Impact Measurement
- **Revenue Attribution**: Direct revenue impact calculation
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Development costs vs. projected gains
- **Competitive Moat**: Unique advantage assessment
- **Scalability Analysis**: Global rollout feasibility and impact

## Quality Assurance & Bias Prevention

### Randomization Verification
- **Balance Checks**: Demographic and behavioral balance across groups
- **Spillover Effects**: Cross-user contamination analysis
- **Selection Bias**: Opt-in vs. random assignment impact assessment

### External Validity
- **Seasonal Effects**: Control for music industry seasonal patterns
- **Competitive Response**: Monitor for external market changes
- **Platform Changes**: Account for concurrent product updates

### Data Quality Monitoring
- **Missing Data**: Imputation strategies and sensitivity analysis
- **Outlier Detection**: Automated outlier identification and handling
- **Data Pipeline Validation**: End-to-end data quality monitoring
