# Experiment 1: Enhanced Randomization in Curated Playlists

## Hypothesis
**"Increasing randomization of new songs and artists in Spotify's curated playlists (Today's Top Hits, RapCaviar, etc.) will improve user discovery and engagement by exposing users to broader musical variety."**

## Success Metrics
**Primary KPIs Impacted:**
- Discovery Success Rate (songs saved from recommendations)
- User Engagement Score (reduced skip rates, increased listening time)

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Playlist completion rate
- Time spent in curated playlists
- Artist diversity score in user libraries
- New artist discovery rate

## Test Design

### Control vs Treatment Groups
- **Control Group (50%)**: Current algorithm with heavy personalization and popularity weighting
- **Treatment Group (50%)**: Enhanced randomization algorithm with:
  - 30% popular/trending tracks (vs 60% in control)
  - 40% personalized recommendations (vs 35% in control)
  - 30% random discovery tracks from emerging artists (vs 5% in control)

### Sample Size & Duration
- **Sample Size**: 2 million active users who engage with curated playlists
- **Statistical Power**: 80% power to detect 5% relative improvement
- **Duration**: 4 weeks to capture weekly listening patterns
- **Minimum Detectable Effect**: 3% change in discovery success rate

### Randomization Strategy
- Users randomly assigned using user_id hash
- Stratified by premium status and listening frequency
- Balanced across geographic regions

## Implementation Details

### Algorithm Changes
1. **Popularity Weighting Adjustment**
   - Reduce weight of popularity scores by 50%
   - Introduce artist diversity penalty for over-representation

2. **Random Discovery Pool**
   - Create pool of emerging artists (<1M monthly listeners)
   - Apply basic quality filters (completion rate >60%)
   - Inject 8-10 tracks per 30-song playlist

3. **Personalization Balance**
   - Maintain user preference compatibility scoring
   - Reduce sequential similarity of tracks
   - Introduce genre variety bonus

### Technical Implementation
- A/B test framework integration
- Real-time playlist generation modification
- Enhanced tracking for discovery attribution

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: User Dissatisfaction
**Risk**: Users may dislike unfamiliar music, leading to increased skips
**Mitigation**: 
- Gradual rollout starting at 10% treatment
- Real-time monitoring of skip rates
- Rollback trigger if skip rate increases >20%

### Risk 2: Reduced Playlist Engagement
**Risk**: Lower overall playlist listening time
**Mitigation**:
- Focus on high-engagement user segments initially
- Maintain familiar artists as "anchor" tracks
- A/B test different randomization percentages

### Risk 3: Artist/Label Relations
**Risk**: Reduced exposure for major label priority tracks
**Mitigation**:
- Communicate experiment goals to label partners
- Maintain minimum guaranteed exposure thresholds
- Track revenue impact on major label content
